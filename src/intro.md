# Introduction

This is a handbook that I use day-to-day in my research. It contains
a lot of basic derivativations related to different
families of probabilitty distributions, general results that find
application in variational or stochastic inference, as well as more
domain-specific articles that relate to different imaging modalities.

This is currently a work-in-progress.
